More-Recipes provides a platform for users to share the awesome and exciting  recipe ideas they  have invented or learnt.  Suppose a user comes up with a recipe,  he/she can post it on  More-Recipes and  get feedback in form of reviews and votes from other users who explore that  recipe. Users can also keep a list of their favorite recipes on the application. This implementation is being done using HTML, Bootstrap 4 and JQUERY libraries for the template, react/redux for the client, and node.js/sequelize for the server
